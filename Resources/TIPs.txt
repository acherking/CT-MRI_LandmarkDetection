Hi Shawn, 

I'm planning to come in tomorrow, but just in case I don't here are the landmark coordinates. You can use the median value (in yellow) for now. This only has data for the CT and MRI pre-op scans. We will have to get the experts to do the post-op CT later. 

The data is in the CT_MRI_Pre_Post folder of the hard drive. Note that there are 2 patients without post-op CTs. We will sort this out later, but this should be enough for you to get your head around the data I think.

Enjoy! 

Regards,
Sudanthi

HI Shawn, 

Here's some code for you to start off with. The main file is generateData.m. You can use it to load the original dicom data and generate and augmented dataset. You can also split into train-test-val sets. Note that we have to make sure that any augmented image has to fall into the same set as its original. This code makes sure thats the case. There's a nameStrings.xls that is used to name the new data. Augmentation is done using a random rotation and translation. The landmark points also undergo the same process. There are comments in the code, so you should be able to follow it easily. If you need clarification please ask. Please also run it and see if there are any files missing. Good luck!

Regards,
Sudanthi
